# SEMI-AUTOMATIC BALL SORTING MACHINE

# Need statement
An industry in Hubballi is looking for a sorting machine that sorts the items based on shape,size and material type etc


## Ball sorting machine
The “ball-sorting machine” is a work-in-progress concept of a purely mechanical machine capable of sorting balls by size order using a selection of sorting algorithms.This machie helps the user to sort the machine by arranging each ball acording to their size and makes the work a lot easier.This machine is widely used in factories but not only for balls but for fruits, marbles.. etc are some of the major used sorting machine in the factories.

Sorting is arranging items in systematical way or grouping similar items. Sorting Machines are used to separate things into predetermined ways. Sorting Machines are designed to make things easier and the Sorting Machine techniques can be optical sorting, digital sorting, sensor sorting, magnet sorting and many more and these equipment sort objects on the basis of color, structural properties, weight, size, chemical composition, shape etc. in automated manner.  Color sorting machine technology can be camera, X-ray, Laser, LED based, Hyper Spectral Imaging. Food sorting machines are integration of mechanical and optical sorting technologies.

Functions performed by these sorting machines can be aligning, packaging, distributing, transporting, collecting, defect removal etc. thereby expediting the processes.

Sorting Machines are used in distribution, packaging, food processing, mining, recycling, waste management, chemical, plastic industries. Another Major application of sorting machines is they are also used for Note Sorting.

Building a simple sorting machine from ordinary craft materials is a great way for kids to explore engineering principles and to experiment with iterative design. Engineers often prototype a solution and find, once they test it, that they need to go back and make changes and then test again. Sometimes these steps are repeated multiple times in the process of creating something that works the way the engineer wants it to work and solves the specific challenge or need. Students can explore these steps of the engineering design process by making their own marble sorting machines out of plastic cups and wooden sticks.
