# B) Justifications

|Design No.	|Objective	|Score Allocated	|Justification for the Score|
|---------------|---------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
|1	|Safety	                |0	|Safety is high due to the balls ad the machine stay in a confined zone|
|	|Ease of Use	        |5	|As the machine is easy to operate|
|	|Portability	        |4	|The machine will be small due to less use of material|
|	|Use of Standard Parts	|3	|Using the materials that are commonly used|
|	|Cost	                |5	|Using of materials that are easy to get at cheap rates|
|2	|Safety	                |0	|Safety is high due to the balls ad the machine stay in a confined zone|
|	|Ease of Use	        |-5	| As mechanical arms are difficult to handle and complex coding|
|	|Portability	        |0	|As mechanical arms are easy to break while shifting|
|	|Use of Standard Parts	|-3	|Using of mechanical arm isn't standard part |
|	|Cost	                |-5	|Will cost high due to mechanical arm|
|3	|Safety	                |0	|Safety is high due to the balls ad the machine stay in a confined zone|
|	|Ease of Use	        |5	|As mechanical arms are difficult to handle and complex coding|
|	|Portability	        |0	|As mechanical arms are easy to break while shifting|
|	|Use of Standard Parts	|0	|Using of mechanical arm isn't standard part|
|	|Cost	                |-10	|Will cost high due to mechanical arm|
|4	|Safety	                |Datum	|Safety is high due to the balls ad the machine stay in a confined zone|
|	|Ease of Use	        |Datum	|Will be hard to use because of complex machinery|
|	|Portability	        |Datum	|The machine would less portable due to  the structure|
|	|Use of Standard Parts	|Datum	|Yes standard parts are used in effective way|
|	|Cost	                |Datum	|Moderate price|
