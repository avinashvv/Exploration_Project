# MOTOR SIZING
## SERVO MOTOR

DIAMETER OF THE MOTOR ROLLER=5cm

DENSITY OF THE BALL=2.70 g/cm^3

VOLUME OF THE BALL=4/3 ×pi ×2.5^3=65.45cm^3 

MASS OF THE BALL=DENSITY  × VOLUME= 176.73 gm=0.176kg

MASS OF THE CONVEYOR BELT=1.06kg

TOTAL MASS=1.236kg

COF BETWEEN RUBBER AND ALUMINIUM=0.5

g=9.8m/^s

FORCE=TOTAL MASS × g × COF=5.88N


TORQUE=F × D/2=5.88 × 0.05/2=0.147Nm


TORQUE=0.147 × 100/9.81=1.49 Kg cm


FACTOR OF SAFETY(FOS)=1.5


FINAL TORQUE=FOS ×TORQUE=2.24Kg cm



CONSIDERING THE FINAL TORQUE REQUIRED WE ARE USING THE TOWER PRO SG-90 SERVO MOTOR WHICH HAS STALL TORQUE OF 2.2 AT 6.6v  





# DC MOTOR 
DIAMETER OF THE ROTOR =5cm

DENSITY OF THE BALL=2.70 g/cm^3

VOLUME OF THE BALL=4/3 ×pi ×r^3

(Considering the balls of diameter 1,2,3,4,5 for shuffling )
 

MASS OF THE BALL=DENSITY  × VOLUME


MASS OF ALL BALLS( VOLUME  × DENSITY )= (65.41× 2.7) +( 33.4 × 2.7) + (0.52 ×  2.7) + (4.189 ×  2.7) +( 14.139 ×  2.7) gm
                 = 317.485gm=0.317kg


TOTAL MASS=0.317kg

g=9.8m/^s

FORCE=TOTAL MASS × g =0.317  × 9.8 =3.106N


TORQUE=F ×  D/2=3.106 × 0.05/2 =0.0776 Nm


TORQUE=0.0776  ×  100/9.81=0.7915 kg cm


FACTOR OF SAFETY(FOS)=1.5


FINAL TORQUE=FOS × TORQUE=0.7915  ×  1.5=1.18kg cm


CONSIDERING THE FINAL TORQUE REQUIRED WE ARE USING WE ARE USING THE 12V,100RPM DC MOTOR WHICH HAS TORQUE OF 2kg cm

# REQUIRED VOLTAGE AND CURRENT SUPPLIES


 ⦿  FOR 5v ,Total current = 1465mA (considering ARDUINO MEGA of 5v,  FOR LED, considering the highest voltage 5v)    


  CONSIDERING FACTOR OF SAFETY AS=1.2


  FINAL POWER REQUIREMENT=5v,(1.2 × 1465)  =5v,1758mA


 ⦿  FOR 12v, Total current=300mA


 CONSIDERING FACTOR OF SAFETY AS =1.2


  FINAL POWER REQUIREMENT=12v,(1.2 × 300)mA =12v,360mA  


CONSIDERING ABOVE CALCULATIONS WE WILL USE 12V 2A ADAPTER ALONG WITH POWER REGULATOR OF 12V TO 5V
